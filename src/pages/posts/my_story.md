Like most people, I wasn't quite sure what I wanted to do as a career after high school. Okay, I actually had no idea. All I knew is that stocking shelves overnight at the local grocery store for the rest of eternity was less than ideal. However, it was a good source of motivaton.

Still without a clue as to what I wanted to do, I applied to the computer program at a local vocational school. While that program only just scratched the surface, it did relight the spark of curiosity that high school had snuffed out. After completing that course I immediately applied to a Computer Networking program at a Community College, and after two grueling years of going to school and working nights, both
full time I received a degree in Computer Networking Technology.

I had a couple failed attempts at learning Python before I found the Codecademy web development course. Once I began these courses I was hooked. With the help of many resources including Codecademy, FreeCodeCamp, Code
Newbies, Dev Tips, the general good will of the people in the community, and, of course, a little hard work, I was able to teach my self web development.

I now have almost three years of experience working with web technologies such as jQuery, React, Redux, Angular, Vue on the front end. On the back end I have worked with Node and Elixir. I have been apart of large enterprise teams maintaining legacy code, as well as being the main developer on green field projects for new startups.

Being a naturally driven and curious person, I am constantly looking to learn new things. Just ask my wife how many times I start a sentence with "I listened to a podcast about...". My curiosity pushes me to constantly improve my craft and never leave a stone unturned when trying to solve a problem.

Not only do I like learning and solving problems myself, but I also enjoy giving back to the community by teaching others and helping them solve their problems. Whether through blog posts, giving talks, or answering questions in community Slack groups, it is very rewarding to be able to pass along the knowledge I have gained and the good will I have received to people that are on the path to becoming software developers.
