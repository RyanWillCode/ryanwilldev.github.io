Like most people, I wasn't quite sure what I wanted to do as a career
after high school. Okay, I actually had no idea. All I knew is that
stocking shelves overnight at the local grocery store for the rest of
eternity was less than ideal. However, it was a good source of
motivaton.
Still without a clue as to what I wanted to do, I applied to the
computer program at a local vocational school. While that program only
just scratched the surface, it did relight the spark of curiosity that
high school had snuffed out. After completing that course I immediately
applied to a Computer Networking program at a Community College, and
after two grueling years of going to school and working nights full time
I received my degree.
At this point I try my hand at programming for the first time. I had a
couple failed attempts at learning Python before I found the Codecademy
courses for web development. Once I began these courses I was hooked.
With the help of many resources including Codecademy, FreeCodeCamp, Code
Newbies, Dev Tips, the general good will of the people in the community,
and, of course, a little hard work, I was able to teach my self web
development.
