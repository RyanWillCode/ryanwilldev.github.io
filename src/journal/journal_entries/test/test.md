#This is just a test

**I need to:**

1. Read the contents of each folder inside journal_entries
2. Find the md files
3. Run the md files through Showdown
4. Take the HTML generated by Showdown and add it to the json file in that dir
5. Add the json to a larger json file
6. repeat for each folder inside journal_entries
7. require the end json file into the journal_entries component

```javascript
var test = testing();
