Recently I converted this site from a single page Vue app to a static site generated with Nuxt.

## What is Nuxt?

[Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/guide) is a framework for easily creating Universal or Server Rendered apps with [Vue](https://vuejs.org/).
It also provides the ability to generate a static version of your site.
This will generate an HTML file for each route of your site.
Allowing you to host your site on any static hosting provider, I used Github pages for this site, while still providing the power of Vue on the frontend.
