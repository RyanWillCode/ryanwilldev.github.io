## Think before you type

* Rich Hickey Hammock driven development

## Follow the idea

* Thinking math course

## Too quick to commit

* Go over your work before calling it finished
* leave comments
* go do something else for a little bit
* come back and see what can be improved

## Be a student

* learn existing techniques
* most likely the thing you are trying to solve has already been figured out
* State management in JS
* Because of the simple nature of FE until recently SM was not needed but now everyone reinventing things that were already figured out
* FP ^

## Program like scientist

* Make hypothesis, test them, adjust based on outcomes

## Step outside your comfort zone - Getting comfortable being uncomfortable

* Push yourself
* when you get that uncomfortable feeling that means your learning
* even if you don't understand something fully now exposing yourself to new and complicated ideas will plant seeds that will help in future

## Do something else you enjoy

* When you see the way broadly you see it in all things
* You will be able to bring lessons back to programming

## Have fun
