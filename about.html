      Hey there, my name is Ryan Will, but I suspect you already knew that. I am
      a self-taught software developer from Tennessee. I am interested in many
      aspects of computer science including networking, web development, and
      programming language design.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being a naturally driven and curious person, I am constantly looking to
      learn new things. Just ask my wife how many times I start a sentence with
      "I listened to a podcast about...". My curiosity pushes me to constantly
      improve my craft and never leave a stone unturned when trying to solve a
      problem.

    Not only do I like learning and solving problems myself, but I also enjoy
    giving back to the community by teaching others and helping them solve their
    problems. Whether through blog posts, giving talks, or answering questions
    in community Slack groups, it is very rewarding to pass along the knowledge
    I have gained and the good will I have received to others on the path to
    becoming software developers.
